## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- The game starts when the Game Master (powered by OpenAI) selects a **very famous movie**.
- You'll receive an **initial hint** to help you begin.
- You can then:
  - Ask **yes/no** questions to gather clues.
  - Or try to **guess the exact movie name** at any time.
- You have a **maximum of 10 attempts** to guess the correct movie.
- **Each wrong guess** (not a question) will reduce your remaining attempts.
- If you guess the movie correctly:
  - You **win**, and your **score is higher** the fewer guesses you used.
- If you run out of attempts without guessing the movie:
  - Itâ€™s **game over**.
- You can type `"quit"` at any time to exit the game.

ðŸ§  Think smart, ask clever questions, and enjoy the game!
